# Anti-Interesting
> **Anti-interesting, adj.**: 1) A subject is said to be anti-interesting if it is absolutely fascinating to the point where there is a strong market for it’s investigation but it threatens an institution capable of stifling discussion inside the [Gated Institutional Narrative (GIN)](the_gated_institutional_narrative_GIN.md).

<blockquote><p>Why is that anti-interesting? Wouldn’t we want to be sure that Epstein’s fortune didn’t come from China, Russia, etc.? Thus we either *know* that it didn’t and aren’t reporting what we know, or we have left the door open to the states that we are certain are trying to control us.</p>&mdash; Eric Weinstein (@EricRWeinstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1233421390029606912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2020</a></blockquote>
