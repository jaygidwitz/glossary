# The 4 Kinds of Fake News

> 1. Narrative
> 1. Algorithmic
> 1. Institutional
> 1. False

~ Eric Weinstain on [The Rubin Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofDXJsKsA30)

Examples:
1. **Narrative**: "Hillary is inevitable."
1. **Algorithmic**: Because we are consuming our media digitally, it is being curated shown to us based on our past clicks. So important stories will be buried deep  down in the feed (deemphasized) when we are already fatigued. (Burying the lead.)
1. **Institutional**: If you are Harvard, or Brookings, you can release what you claim to be objective fact and you are given courteous reception, even though it's not really objective news.
1. **Fake News**: Somebody is making something up.
