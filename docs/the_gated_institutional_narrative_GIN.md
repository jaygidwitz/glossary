# The Gated Institutional Narrative (GIN)

> The '''Gated Institutional Narrative''' is like an exchange, a financial exchange, except it's an exchange of information and ideas.

> In order to actually participate in this particular special conversation, you need to have a seat on the exchange that is you need to write for an important paper, like the Wall Street Journal, or you need to be a Senator or a Congressman so that you can gain access to the news media, where you need to be sitting at a news desk in any of these situations, whether you're a professor, or a reporter, or a politician if you can gain a seat inside of the Gated Institutional Narrative, you can attempt to converse with other people within that particular conversation.

> The rest of us do not have the same level, or kind of access to this highly rarefied discussion. It's comparable to what we would term a promotion inside of the world of professional wrestling. [It's an agreed-upon structure in which people often agree to simulate dispute](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783). Rather than actually have disputes because somebody could get really seriously injured, but they are in fact, working together to produce, an engaging, and regular product for mass-consumption.

> The problem with this gated institutional narrative is that in general, it doesn't contain the most important ideas. And that is where the gating function comes in. The most important ideas are likely to be the ideas that are the most disruptive:

> * What if the entire food pyramid, for example, was wildly off? What if fats were not the great danger we thought they were and those waving, uh, fields of wheat that are fabled in American song. In fact, give rise to carbs, which are very dangerous to us all.
> * So if everything were inverted, let's say we're in a world where instead of banishing volatility during the so-called great moderation, before 2008, we were actually building the Tinder for the world's largest financial forest fire.
> * What if in fact, we had all sorts of things, exactly backward and completely wrong?
> * What if diversity, wasn't a sign of our strength, but sometimes a sign of our weakness.
> * What if, for example, immigration. Uh, far from being an issue of xenophobes versus xenophiles was actually an instance of redistribution having little to do with xenophobia or xenophilia to begin with?

> These sorts of ideas, can't be entertained inside of the gated institutional narrative.

> And that's where the gating function comes in. What was originally I function intended to ensure quality control of the narrative became an instrument for something else.

The **Gated Institutional Narrative (GIN)** is a sociological phenomenon describing the often heavily generalised nature in which information is presented by the media, politicians and other sectors of the commentariat. It is a neologism commonly attributed to mathematician, economist and author, Eric Weinstein.

The manner in which different gated institutional narratives emerge can be attributed to the logic of the sociological method where individuals make sense of the world. This is most apparent when an institution (media outlet, politician etc) lies to the public, misrepresents the truth or omits information. Such actions are motivated by the belief that the public are unable to follow the analytical subtext of an argument and require the use of narrative instead.

Arguably, it is the sociological equivalence of academic malpractice.<sup>[1][1]</sup>

Any GIN can be identified as an institutional narrative that, for whatever reason, creates for itself an exclusive arbiter of ideas and chooses to condemn alternative sense-making apparatuses.<sup>[2]</sup>

In essence, an institutional condemnation of any alternative analysis to its own is what forms the figurative 'gating'..

Incidentally, this pattern has led to an increasing number of unofficial members of the Intellectual Dark Web (IDW).<sup>[3]</sup>

The IDW is humorously named 'dark' to recognize those who involuntarily become rogue/stealth as a result of being "excommunicated" by gated institutional narratives.<sup>[2]</sup>.<sup>[2]</sup>

Recent examples of modern GINs and relative alternative sense makers include but are not limited to:

- **The Twitter Banning of The Articles of Unity**
- **Evergreen State College**: Bret Weinstein<sup>[4]</sup>
- **Parliament of Canada**: Jordan Peterson<sup>[5]</sup>
- **Google**: James Damore<sup>[6][7]</sup>
- **Feminism**: Christina Hoff Sommers<sup>[8]</sup>
