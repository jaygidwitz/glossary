# The N^2 Revolution

This idea was shared with Eric on Dec, 07, 2017. The No Name Revolution, or N^2 Revolution, is the name Eric has given crisis we are currently facing. He proposes that our current cultural predicament was caused by our loss of Semi-Reliable Communal Sense-making. This is the sum total of the [DISC](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Distributed_Idea_Suppression_Complex), [EGOs](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Embedded_Growth_Obligation), and [Load-Bearing Fictions](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Load-Bearing_Fictions) being realized.

"...there was enough complex for us to function as a country and I think that has gone away. So I think that this (our loss of Semi-Reliable Communal Sense-making) is the parent of the crisis which I increasingly think of as, what I call it is: The No Name Revolution or the N squared revolution. We are in some sort of new regime which doesn't look like revolution we have seen before. It's much physically violent, so far. It is digitally extremely violent. And it has to do with the fact that we cannot make sense of things communally at some semi-reliable level."
