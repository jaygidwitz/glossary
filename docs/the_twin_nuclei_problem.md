> The Twin Nuclei Era began in the space of four months in 1952-3 with the first test of the Teller-Ulam fusion device in early November of 1952 followed by the discovery of 3D structure of DNA in late February of 1953.

> Ultimately our home is in the stars or not at all. There is simply now too much power to wield for those with no real dreams beyond wielding power.


> In 1945 we ended WWII with atomic devices. This was the end of conventional massive armed conflict.
> 
> Between 1952-54 we cracked the twin nuclei of atoms (Hydrogen fusion bombs) and cells (3-d structure of DNA).
> 
> We now live on borrowed time determined largely by luck, growth and the memory of WWII.
> 
> Our growth ran out, then our memory of WWII. We now live on Luck.
> 
> This has created a world wide epidemic of magical thinking that nothing truly bad can still happen.
> 
> During the 1945-1972 Epoch, growth was economically high, stable, broadly distributed, technologically lead.
> 
> During this period Derek de Solla Price discovered that science was on an unsustainable exponential.
> 
> He published 'Science Since Babylon' (1959?) predicting an end to scientific growth.
> 
> Science is upstream of technology which is upstream of markets. And the predicted end came around 1972.
> 
> During the 1945-1972 era, institutions built in assumptions about their future growth.
> 
> Those Embedded Growth Obligations or E.G.0.s are now unsustainable.
> 
> This has caused nearly all institutions to be headed by people willing to lie to keep the institutions alive.
> 
> There are a small number of fields where growth kept going (E.g. semiconductors, communications, and their outgrowths).
> 
> Mostly the world stagnated by the standards of the past around 1972.
> 
> Between 1972 and 2008 a long period of managed fake growth took place to disguise the end of the post WWII growth regime.
> 
> This was called, downsizing, deregulation, mergers/aquisition, globalization, 'best brightest' immigration, securitization, financialization. Etc.
> 
> Starting in the 1990s this Davos style economics began to result in massive wealth inequality in the developed world under a fig leaf of idealism.
> 
> By 2008, fake growth became unsustainable and the world woke up from a crazy dream of "The Great Moderation' to sanity.
> 
> It was that sanity that made the markets "go crazy."
> 
> Since 2008, no one really believes in market absolutism nor in government fairness nor in banking. But, oddly, we can't form new economic theories.
> 
> This zombie period lasted from 2008 until 2016 where the Trump and Brexit votes shocked the rent-seeking elite.
> 
> We are now trying to have new ideas. It is very difficult for them to form given the level of inequality.
> 
> As for the decision trees: if humanity is to have a future greater than 500 years with fusion devices and other horrors, what must happen?
> 
> A) A great run of luck must occur.
> 
> B) An outbreak of unprecidented wisdom happens.
> 
> C) We upload into silicon.
> 
> D) We stabilize the environment and grow all markets so no one has reason to want.
> 
> E) We move to the moon, mars and a few spacestations to diversity which is sufficient.
> 
> F) We escape the solar system with new physics.
> 
> G) We establish universal surveilance so no surprises can occur.
> 
> H) We terminate shortly.
> 
> Note that all of the above....ALL...are crazy. There are no non-crazy possibilities.
